# CarpoleAIAgent
This is an Implementation of Nicholas Renotte's Deep Reinforcement Learning Tutorial for Python in 20 Minutes.
The main reason for me to upload my implementation despite following almost strictly the tutorial, was because of the OpenaAI gym environment Windows OS visualization, that proven to be a dantesque task. 

Fortunatly, Google Colab with the proper dependecies installed came out as a good rendering solution, so this workarround might be usefull to other machine learning developers. 

As an interesting side note that I would like to add, is the mention of the final testing of the model in a different version of the Carpole game of where it was trained. 
The results speak for themeselves. 

Tecnhologies used:
OpenAI (gym environment) - CartPole Game
Keras 
Kera RL
Tensorflow
GoogleColab for windows gym visualization
